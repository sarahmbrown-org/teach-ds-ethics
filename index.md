```{slide} Integrating Ethics into Data Science Courses
:class: title
```

```{slide}

> Do you practice ethical data science?

```


```{ifnotslides}
How did you learn to do that?
```


```{ifnotslides}

Did you have formal data ethics training?

Did you have formal discipline based ethics training?
```

```{slide}  Where we are going
:class: build

I want you to leave with:

* something small enough that you can do it this semester

* something you can implement next semester

* ideas so that you can develop bigger ideas over time


```



```{slide} How we will do that

- About me
- Goals
- Examples

```

```{slide}  About Me
```

```{slide} I am an engineer

- engineering is professionalized
- ABET accreditation standardizes somewhat



```


# Engineering Design process

Building intuition

<!-- no calculator exam -->



```{slide} Applications

- Human subject research at MGH Breast Imaging Research
- BAE Systems Target Development Lab
- Human subject research at C.S. Draper Laboratory
- ML Lab with many collaborators: psyhologists, civil engineers, physician scientists


```



```{slide} Training in Instruction and Design

```

```{note}
In addition to my own ethical development, I am going to pause to note in particular my training in evidence based teaching practices.

> Data science ethics is not, and cannot be, a thing the way that biomedical ethics or legal ethics,or even engineering ethics are.




```

```{note}
Data science is a set of tehniques that can be applied anywhere-- this is part of what makes it so exciting and engaging and fun, but those other domains: biomedicine, law, engineering, are domains of both skills and practices AND of knowledge in how the world works. Those domains interface with the world in a fundamentally different way than data science.

# So what can we do?


```{slide} General  Framework

- safety through correctness/ robustness
- consider points of failure
- incorporate context

```

# This Semester


```{slide} Spend More Time on Evaluation

- frame evaluation as competing goals
- always require more than one metric

```

````{slide} Evaluation First

<!-- ```{tip} -->

- what is a model
- how do we evaluate them
- how do we train them
<!-- ```  -->

````


```{slide} Talk about where data comes from

- Discuss before loading data
- Distribute Datasheets
- Have students write data sheets

```

```{slide} Consider Deployment

- add a reflection question, Would you deploy this model, under what circumstances yes/no? etc
- case study on models that have been taken back
- model cards- read or write them

```



```{slide} Make your plan of action

- What is one thing you will do this semester?
- What is one thing you want to learn more about?

```


```{ifnotslides}

For data science ethics education to change the course of data science practice outside of the academy, ethics must be integrated throughout a student's education and deeply connected to practical computational choices. This session will equip each attendee with small changes that can be made in the current semester and a framework for broader course revisions to deeply integrate ethical thinking into their data science courses.
