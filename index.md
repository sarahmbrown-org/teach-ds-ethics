# Incorporating Ethics into Data Science Courses


```{slide} Warm Up
:level: 2

Is your work in data science ethical?
```


```{ifnotslides}
How did you learn to do that?
```


```{slide}

Did you have formal data ethics training?

Did you have formal discipline based ethics training?
```

```{slide}  Where we are going


I want you to leave with:

* something small enough that you can do it this semester

* something you can implement next semester

* ideas so that you can develop bigger ideas over time


```



```{slide} How we will do that

- About me
- Goals
- Examples

```

## About Me

```{slide} I am an engineer

- professionalized
- ABET accreditation standardizes somewhat
```


## Engineering Design process

```{slide}
Building intuition
```
<!-- no calculator exam -->



```{slide} Applications

- Human subject research at MGH Breast Imaging Research
- BAE Systems Target Development Lab
- Human subject research at C.S. Draper Laboratory
- ML Lab with many collaborators: psyhologists, civil engineers, physician scientists
```



```{slide} Training in Instruction and Design

```

```{slide} FAccT Scholarship
```

```{slide}
> Data science ethics is not, and cannot be, a *thing* the way that biomedical ethics or legal ethics, or even engineering ethics are *things*.

```

```{slide}
## General  Framework

- safety through correctness/ robustness
- consider points of failure
- incorporate context

```

```{slide}
## Wrap up

- What is one thing you will do this semester?
- What is one thing you want to learn more about?

```


```{ifnotslides}

For data science ethics education to change the course of data science practice outside of the academy, ethics must be integrated throughout a student's education and deeply connected to practical computational choices. This session will equip each attendee with small changes that can be made in the current semester and a framework for broader course revisions to deeply integrate ethical thinking into their data science courses.
